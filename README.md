# School_District_Analysis
**1) Overview/ Purpose:**
  
   The purpose of this analysis was to be able to find/ locate specific elements in multiple databases and manipulate them to answer specific questions that we had based on the information in the databases. During the module we spent our time summarizing school spending, average scores for math and reading, school size, and scores by school type. In the challenege we were to expand on this knowledge and seperate the students scores that were only in 9th grade, rerun the school district analysis and compare how much the information was changed due to changing information in our databases. We showed how much Thomas high school's % overall passing grades were increased once the 9th grade was nulled and how that later affected the whole district summary report. 
   
   **Results**
   
   The district summary was affected because we changed the number of students that were being calculated in the math and reading percentages for each school. After we nulled the ninth grade reading and math scores we then found a new percentage from the total students that were left to count and found new passing math, passing reading and overall passing percentages for the school district. This changed the numbers by only a few percentage points closer to 0.5-1% but can still cause larger results the more information we have. We called the new total number of students "new_student_count" and made our predictions for the school district based on this number.

  The school summary was affected because after we nulled the ninth grade reading and math scores we had to change the school summary percentage grades for Thomas High School. These final percentage grades were skewed because of the incorrect input the ninth grade had on the reading and math. Once we changed the overall grades to only reflect 10-12th graders at Thomas High School the average scores went up by quite a bit. Increasing from around an overall passing grade of 65% to almost 91%.

Replacing the scores has affected Thomas High School's performance against the other schools in a very positive way. Because of this their overall passing percentage has increased and actually gave them a spot at second place in the top 5 performing schools list. Before changing the grades Thomas High School was right in the middle when it came to how well they performed compared to the other schools in this data frame.
